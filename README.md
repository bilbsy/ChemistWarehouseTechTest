My React is slightly out dated and will be adding a React portion of this test over time, once I refresh that skillset using this test. Currently only the dotnet swagger UI is viewable.

1. Install SQL Server 2022 and SQL server 2022 Configuration Manager
2. Load project and add /swagger to end of the url
